  title: Regularized Newton Methods for minimizing functions with Hölder continuous Hessians
  abstract: >
    In this paper, we study the regularized second-order methods for
    unconstrained minimization of a twice-differentiable (convex or nonconvex)
    objective function. For the current function, these methods automatically
    achieve the best possible global complexity estimates among different
    Hölder classes containing the Hessian of the objective. We show that such
    methods for functional residual and for the norm of the gradient must be
    different. For development of the latter methods, we introduced two new
    line-search acceptance criteria, which can be seen as generalizations of
    the Armijo condition.

  title: Global Hypoellipticity of Invariant Linear Operators on Smooth Manifolds
  abstract: >
    At first glance, the subject may seem very far from the topics
    usually discussed in our seminars. However, a key point of Fernando's work is
    the study of eigenvalues/eigenvectors of matrices with special structure,
    which is also Numerical Linear Algebra matter. Therefore, this talk is an
    attempt to bring together people from different areas and create a chance for
    we help each other!

  title: Stability issues in numerical methods for a fluid-structure interaction problem
  abstract: >
    In this seminar I shall present ideas and results from the article [1]
    regarding a simplified 2-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem.
    We will consider a fluid (Euler equations) in a rectangular domain coupled
    with  generalized springs on the horizontal boundaries. Three possible
    algorithms for the solution of the problem will be shown  and their
    stability will be analyzed by the introduction of a linear operator called
    "added-mass".

  title: "Construction of quadratic models for derivative-free trust-region algorithms: polynomial interpolation versus support vector regression."
  abstract: >
    We consider derivative-free trust-region algorithms based on sampling
    approaches for convex constrained problems and discuss two conditions on
    the quadratic models for ensuring their global convergence. The first
    condition requires the poisedness of the sample sets, as usual in this
    context, while the other one is related to the error between the model and
    the objective function at the sample points. Although the second condition
    trivially holds if the model is constructed by polynomial interpolation,
    since in this case the model coincides with the objective function at the
    sample set, we show that it also holds for models constructed by support
    vector regression. These two conditions imply that the error between the
    gradient of the trust-region model and the objective function is of the
    order of the radius that controls the diameter of the sample set. This
    allows proving the global convergence of a trust-region algorithm that
    uses two radii, the sample set radius and the trust-region radius.
    Numerical experiments are presented for minimizing functions with and
    without noise.
