  title: An introduction to Gevrey Spaces.
  abstract: >
   In this talk we introduce the Gevrey spaces by analyzing the solutions of some PDE's. 
   The main tool in our approach is the use of Fourier coefficients of smooth functions and distributions.

  title: Higher order Internal Wave Models
  abstract: >
    From a higher order strongly nonlinear model for the evolution of internal waves at intermediate depth, we obtained a 
    weakly nonlinear system similar to a Boussinesq system for surface gravity waves. The main difference between these systems 
    is the presence of a dispersive term involving a Hilbert Transform on the strip, which is a nonlocal singular integral operator. 
    Results concerning local well-posedness, conservation laws and some travelling wave solutions are discussed.
