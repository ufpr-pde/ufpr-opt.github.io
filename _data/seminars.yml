   abstract: >
    In this paper, we study the regularized second-order methods for
    unconstrained minimization of a twice-differentiable (convex or nonconvex)
    objective function. For the current function, these methods automatically
    achieve the best possible global complexity estimates among different
    Hölder classes containing the Hessian of the objective. We show that such
    methods for functional residual and for the norm of the gradient must be
    different. For development of the latter methods, we introduced two new
    line-search acceptance criteria, which can be seen as generalizations of
    the Armijo condition.
